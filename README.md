NBA Player Stats, Team Win Rates, and Betting Odds

In this project, data is scraped from the NBA stats websites and betting odds websites.
NBA stats are used to predict teams' win rates for any given match, and these win rates
are used in conjunction with the betting odds to recommend the optimal team to bet on
for any given game.


Depending on how you decide to download and save the csv data files,
the code may not find the necessary data files in the desginated paths.
In that case, change the code or the file locations to make the code work.


Some of the code's formatting may be messed up when viewed from GitHub. The code will
still work but it is best viewed in JupyerNotebook for cleaner formatting appearances.
