NBA Player Stats, Team Win Rates, and Betting Odds

In this project, data is scraped from the NBA stats websites and betting odds websites.
NBA stats are used to predict teams' win rates for any given match, and these win rates
are used in conjunction with the betting odds to recommend the optimal team to bet on
for any given game.

These are the highest weighted (most definitive) advanced player metrics that determine how impactful a player is to a team's success.

These are our predicted win rates of all teams by the end of the 2019 NBA season (Ends April, 2019). Note that these predictions were made in Oct, 2018, and the top 4 teams' win rates were at most only 0.03 off from the actual end of season standings and win rates.
