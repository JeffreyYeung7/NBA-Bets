NBA Player Stats, Team Win Rates, and Betting Odds

In this project, data is scraped from the NBA stats websites and betting odds websites.
NBA stats are used to predict teams' win rates for any given match, and these win rates
are used in conjunction with the betting odds to recommend the optimal team to bet on
for any given game.
